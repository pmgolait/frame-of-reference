# Some Reasons Why *Shutter Island* Is My Favorite Movie

*Shutter Island* is a 2010 American neo-noir psychological thriller/horror movie based on the works of *Dennis Lehane*, directed by *Martin Scorsese*, with phenomenal actors like *Leonardo DiCaprio*, *Mark Ruffalo*, and *Ben Kingsley* playing major roles.

Now, opinions are obviously subjective, and that subjective factor plays a significant role in this opinion. Probably because this was the first movie that introduced me to the psychological thriller genre (which has now become my favorite), combined with the *when*, *where*, and *how* I saw it, along with the amount of emotional weight the film carries, the plot and its skilful execution, the environment, music, and acting—everything about it is brilliantly unsettling.

For those who haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend this movie. Also, like many other movies of this genre (which provide great research-worthy content), this is a one-time experience; the entire meaning of the movie and your perception change when you watch it for the second time. So cherish the first watch, and make sure you watch it without any disturbances or breaks to feel the full intensity of the emotions that the movie is trying to convey.

**[SPOILERS AHEAD!]**

I'm assuming at this point you've already watched the movie and know how the doctors are trying to help Teddy accept the truth so they can perform a lobotomy on him. I won't be discussing the plot or getting into minute details in this article; you'll find plenty of resources already available for the same (also, when you rewatch it, you'll be able to see things more clearly). I'd like to get to a few subjective parts and explore those areas.

- Let's start right off with my favorite scene of the movie:

The choice of background music, first of all, is top-notch—it's Mahler's Quartet for Piano and Strings, as mentioned in the film (also check out Beethoven's Sonata No. 4 in E Minor; out of context, but a great piece of composition). It sets a somewhat eerie or haunting tone that reflects the film's psychological depth.

Then there’s the passive-aggressive conversation between Dr. Naehring and the Marshals:

> - Dr. Jeremiah Naehring: Men like you are my specialty, you know. Men of violence.
> - Chuck Aule: Now, that's a hell of an assumption to make.
> - Dr. Jeremiah Naehring: No assumption, no, not at all. You misunderstand me. I said you are 'men of violence.' I'm not accusing you of being violent men. That's quite different.

The music builds up as the emotions intensify further when Teddy gets flashbacks of his service...

> - Dr. Jeremiah Naehring: Since the schoolyard, neither of you has ever walked away from a physical conflict. No, no, not because you enjoyed it, but because retreat isn't something you consider an option.
> - Chuck Aule: We weren't raised to run, Doc.
> - Dr. Jeremiah Naehring: Ah, yes. "Raised." And who raised you, Marshal?
> - Teddy Daniels: Me? Wolves.
>   [*Dr. Naehring and Dr. Cawley laugh again*]
> - Dr. Jeremiah Naehring: Very impressive defense mechanisms.

This, and what follows, is one of the most interesting and psychologically revealing conversations I’ve ever come across, and the way this was executed makes this scene perfect from start to finish. It was at this scene that I decided this would be my favorite movie, no matter what happens in the end, and I wasn't disappointed in my decision.

- The Most Dramatic Scene Ever:

I suppose this requires no explanation. Although it's interesting to think about how the human brain can cope with things, it highlights the lengths one might go to avoid facing harsh truths or maybe even simple ones.

- The Final Scene:

Now, this scene has a lot of various interpretations (something that directors tends to do with their movies, leaving it open for interpretation) , but the one with which I've found peace is that Teddy remembers the truth this time but continues with the act of being a Marshal so that he can "die as a good man" rather than "live as a monster." He goes with the doctors to get a lobotomy, as it would be an escape from his suffering and memories after accepting that he isn't some heroic U.S. Marshal but rather a man who murdered his wife and created an alter ego to escape from the unbearable pain of his reality.

These were some of the many reasons why *Shutter Island* has such a hold on me.

Some research-worthy topics:

- Lobotomy
- Repression
- Moral Implications of Humans
- PTSD (+ emotional numbing)

Thanks for joining me on this exploration. Until next time!
